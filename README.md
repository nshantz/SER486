Backup Repository for my Embedded C class

This repository is simply a place to backup all of my various Embedded C code for the Raspberry Pi used in my class.

This includes my assignments and potential projects for the class to help me understand how to program in the C language and with GPIO 
pins. 

I do not mind if you use my work as reference, however this is purely custom work (except for the blink example in Assignment 1)
that I have produced in order to complete assignments. If you do use this code as reference, be careful not to plagiarize and to give
credit where applicable. 

Hopefully these pieces of software are useful in understanding programming in the C language for the Raspberry Pi. 

Happy Coding!
